## 🛠 Multi-Platform Docker Build with `buildx`

To build and push a multi-platform Docker image (e.g., for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64), follow these steps:

1. Create and use a new buildx builder

    ```
    docker buildx create --name multi-platform-build-container --use
    docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
    ```

2. Enable QEMU emulation (if not already set up)

    ```
    docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
    ```

3. If you are building multi-platform image from WSL or windows, do not forget to convert `docker-entrypoint.sh` into unix

    ```
    dos2unix docker-entrypoint.sh
    ```

4. Build and push the multi-platform image

    ```
    docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t <IMAGE NAME>:1.0.0 .
    ```
